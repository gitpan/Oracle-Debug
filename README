DESCRIPTION

A Perl (perldb-like) interface to the Oracle supplied DBMS_DEBUG package for debugging PL/SQL programs.

For more info see L<perldoc Oracle::Debug>

*** CAVEAT LECTOR ***

Note that this package is an alpha release!

That is, it is in a state which proves the concept; it works for me,
in a bare-bones manner, and I am now working on making it more robust.

At the very least you will probably have to kill the target process with
a CTRL-C or similar, but this should be harmless enough.  Also, it is
probably unlikely that you can reconnect in the middle of a debugger
session, it is preferable to quit both sessions and start again, etc.
Getting and setting variables processes are also prone to failures
or crashes.  

Debugging procedures appears possible, but packages have a problem.
If you wrap the packaged procedure in an external procedure (like the
example supplied), you should have no problems.

No-one else is expected to use this in anger yet, but you're welcome to try :-)

Full installation instructions and depencies are in the ./INSTALL file

See also the ./demo/oradb file which shows stepping through the 
accompanying procedure into an associated package.
