DESCRIPTION

A Perl (perldb-like) interface to the Oracle supplied DBMS_DEBUG package for debugging PL/SQL programs.

For more info see L<perldoc Oracle::Debug>

*** CAVEAT LECTOR ***

Note that this package is an alpha release!

That is, it is in a state which proves the concept; it works for me,
in a bare-bones manner, and I am now working on making it more robust.

At the very least you will probably have to kill the target process with
a CTRL-C or similar, but this should be harmless enough.  Also, it is
probably unlikely that you can reconnect in the middle of a debugger
session, it is preferable to quit both sessions and start again, etc.

Debugging procedures appears possible, but packages have a problem.
If you wrap the packaged procedure in an external procedure (like the
example supplied), you should have no problems.

No-one else is expected to use this in anger yet, but you're welcome to try :-)

Full installation instructions and depencies are in the ./INSTALL file

See also the ./demo/oradb file which shows stepping through the
accompanying procedure (./packages/xproc.sql) into an associated package
(./packages/package.sql).
