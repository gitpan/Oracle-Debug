DESCRIPTION

A Perl (perldb-like) interface to the Oracle supplied DBMS_DEBUG package for debugging PL/SQL programs.

For more info see L<perldoc Oracle::Debug>

*** CAVEAT LECTOR ***

Note that this package is an alpha release!

That is, it is in a state which proves the concept; it works for me,
and I am now working on making it more robust and general purpose.

No-one else is expected to use it in anger yet, but you're welcome to try :-)

*** CAVEAT LECTOR ***

Full installation instructions are in the ./INSTALL file

See also the ./scripts/demo file which shows stepping through the 
accompanying procedure into an associated package.
